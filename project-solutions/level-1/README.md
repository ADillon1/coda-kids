# Level 1

## Overview

This first project in the book is some introductory practice with using the 
python language, focusing on project workflow, function calls, while loops, syntax, angles, arithmetic and possibly some svariables. It was created in python's native turtle graphics library, and thus doesn't require the coda-kids library used for the exercies that follow it.

The goal of the assignment is to use a series of function calls to instruct a car (represented by the arrow) how to navigate a maze like road structure to get to the destination shown on the map. There are no collisions or state, as the map is given to provide a goal for students as they play around with the various controls for turtle graphics, which is a line drawing tool.

There are 3 functions that can be called in turtle graphics:

turtle.right(num_degrees)
Turns the turtle right

turtle.forward(num_pixels)
Moves the turtle 

turtle.left(num_degrees)
Turns the turtle left

These functions will perform actions on the turtle in the order they are listed in the program.
