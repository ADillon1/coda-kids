#Executable files of project for windows and mac

**Test Steps:** </br>
1. Download the zip files to your computer.
2. Unzip the file and you will see the folder with the level name (like "TurtleMap_Solution").
3. Open the folder and scroll down to the bottom, there is an executable file among all the other setup files ("TurtleMap_Solution" for Mac and "TurtleMap_Solution.exe" for Windows).
4. Open the exe file and you will see the game running.
5. *For Mac, you may see a warning like 
```"TurtleMap_Solution cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." ```
It is a setting that you can change in "Security & Privacy" in "System Preferences", which is "allow apps downloaded from - anywhere". </br>
If there is no such choice in current MacOS version, you can open Terminal and change the setting by typing in:
```sudo spctl --master-disable```
Then you may try to open the exe file again.
